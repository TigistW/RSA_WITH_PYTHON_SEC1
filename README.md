# RSA_WITH_PYTHON_SEC1
we have to attach two files with two different code
the files.....is prime and gcd multiplication.py, decrpt.py, encrpt.py, main function.py and multi inverse.py
belong to one code( the p and q are take by input)

our other implementation isof RSA algorthimis...
the next file...rsa1.py, rsa2.py, rsa3.py, rsa4.py and rsa5 belong to one code which generet p and q randomly.
